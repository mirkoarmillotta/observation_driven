# Observation driven models for discrete-valued time series

Replication code and relative plots for simulations and data analysis of Armillotta M., Luati A. and Lupparelli M. (2021+). Observation driven models for discrete-valued time series.

The code for the simulations of Section 4.2 (and Section 2.1 of the Supplementary materials) is stored in the file "simulations.R" . The code for the model selection performed in the same Section 4.2 (and Section 2.2 of the Supplementary materials) can be found in two separated files: "model selection binomial.R" and "model selection poisson.R" .

Moreover, in the file "applications.R" the code for the two real data examples of Section 5 (and Section 3 of the Supplementary materials) is provided. The file "functions.R" stores all the functions involved in the applications; in this file, the code to perform the PIT is due to Claudia Czado, Tilmann Gneiting, and Leonhard Held. Predictive model assessment for count data. Biometrics, 65(4):1254â€“1261, 2009.

Finally, the dataset "hurricane.txt" (and a CSV version) employed in the application is attached.
